# Route-Planning-Project
A project that plans a fast and safe route from source to destination from a database of KML files (Google Earth). It takes into considerations of traffic signals, number of turns in the way, drops in speed/velocity of the vehicle and computes the best route to reach destination in minimum time.

Any of the kml files can be opened using Google Earth. Once you open the Google Earth website, please follow these steps:
- Click on "Menu" in the top right corner.
- Select "Projects" under menu.
- Select "Open" and a dropdown list will be displayed.
- Import KML file from Google Drive or Computer (wherever the file is saved)
- Finally, the route will be loaded onto Google Earth.


**Please go through the write up PDF file. The complete project report is explained in detail.**
